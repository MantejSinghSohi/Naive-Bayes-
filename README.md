# Introduction
This project involves developing a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch to classify iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. The project includes implementing the
Naive Bayes classifier, evaluating its performance with different bin sizes for continuous features, and analyzing its robustness to noise.
